About LUKS
==========

 LUKS is the Linux Unified Key Setup, it is the default method for disk encryption on Linux. You can choose *Full Disk Encryption* as an option during the installation of most modern Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, which reduces the technical knowledge required to *clicking a checkbox* and *entering a password*.

 * Advantages: LUKS is available through dm-crypt which is part of the Linux kernel, so it doesn't need any further software to be installed.

 * Disadvantages: Unlike with Truecrypt, it is not possible to use it with other Operating Systems, so if you use LUKS to encrypt a USB drive, you can only use it on Linux machines, but not on Windows or Mac OS.


If you want to encrypt a device after the Linux installation completed, you can either use the *Disks* utility which can be found in most Linux distribution's *System Settings*.
