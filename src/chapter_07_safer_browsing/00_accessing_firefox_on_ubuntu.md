Why Firefox?
============

Firefox is open source software, developed by the non-profit organisation, the Mozilla Foundation. As such, it is independent from the interests of any one specific company. It is also highly extensible through the add-ons and plugins, which allows users greater control over how the browser acts as compared to Internet Explorer or Chrome (and it's Open Source companion, Chromium). It should however be noted that this extensibility through add-ons is a double-edged sword and as such add-ons also have great power to subvert the browsers normal activities as well as enhance them.

Accessing Firefox on Ubuntu
===========================

Firefox is already installed on Ubuntu by default. To open it, click on the Unity side bar where you see the Firefox icon:
