Secure Messaging
================

SMS are short messages sent between mobile phones. The text is sent without encryption and can be read and stored by mobile phone providers and other parties with access to the network infrastructure to which you're connected. To protect your messages from interception you need to use end-to-end encryption on your text messages.

Android - Installing TextSecure
---------------------------

TextSecure is a messaging client that allows you to send encrypted text messages and push messages. It provides end-to-end encryption using a modified version of OTR-like library called the an axolotl ratchet. This help provide both asynchronous messaging and group messaging. Supporting both SMS and MMS messaging, TextSecure is a drop in replacement for your stock messaging application on Android. TextSecure also stores all of your messages in an encrypted database. Furthermore, TextSecure will transparently use end-to-end encryption for any other TextSecure user, without need to share keys before hand (although you should verify public keys as much as possible). Again, TextSecure requires the use of the Google Play framework.
